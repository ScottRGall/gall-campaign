Choices matter, combat can be dangerous, and caution is sometimes the wiser path. Without meaningful consequences, there is no reason to be careful.Resurrection magic exists in the world but follows normal rules. Time limits apply, required spells must be available, and material costs are in line with published rules. Not every death will be easily reversible, and resurrection is never guaranteed to be immediate or convenient.If a character dies, we will handle it respectfully and collaboratively. Options may include resurrection if circumstances allow, introducing a new character, or weaving the loss into the story in a meaningful way.The goal is not to punish players, but to ensure tension, stakes, and emotional weight remain part of the game.Experience will be done through Milestones, I.E. when the DM says you level up... we level your characters up. This will typically be done at the tail end of a session so anyone who needs help doing so may stay after and get the help they need. We will use the optional flanking rules in combat.When two allies are positioned on opposite sides of a creature and both can attack it, they gain advantage on melee attacks against that creature. This applies equally to player characters and enemies.Positioning and movement matter. Enemies will use flanking when it makes sense, just as players can.<br>When leveling players will have the choice to either take the default HP increase or roll their hit points at the table (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player/Rules/Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e\" data-href=\"Player/Rules/Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e\" href=\"player/rules/hit-point-increases-in-d&amp;d-5e.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hit Point Increases in D&amp;D 5e</a>), should you roll a 1 you may re-roll once per level. <br>Choose your <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player/Rules/Alignment\" data-href=\"Player/Rules/Alignment\" href=\"player/rules/alignment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alignment</a> carefully, I'd like to use these as a guide for how your character will react in situations<br>Racial Bonuses will be used as written in the 5e Players handbook (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/races\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/races\" target=\"_self\">Racial Ability Score Increases – D&amp;D Basic Rules</a>)We will not be strictly using encumbrance, but I will likely slow you down some if you start carrying around something which is obviously going to slow you down...We will be using the formula (2 x dice) + mod. Will depending on narrative cause a fumble which may, harm you or someone else you didn't intend, drop a weapon... things like this. I won't be breaking weapons etc. on you. The DM may award Inspiration for exceptional role playing, meaningful character driven choices, or moments that strongly reflect a character’s values.Inspiration can be spent to gain advantage on a single roll and does not stack. For most situations, up to two different characters may attempt the same skill check. Alternatively, one character may take the lead while another provides help, granting advantage on the roll.For group checks, everyone involved will roll. The lowest roll is discarded (when 6+ players are rolling), and the majority result will generally determine the outcome, adjusted as needed for the narrative situation.We use standard 5e resting rules. A short rest is at least 1 hour of downtime during which you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points. A long rest is at least 8 hours of rest including sleep. After a long rest you regain all hit points and some Hit Dice back. You can benefit from only one long rest per 24 hours.<br>\nFor full details see the official Basic Rules: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\"

She was caring for something unexpected: a small clutch of albino dragons, runts and hatchlings that could not survive elsewhere. What first looked strange quickly revealed itself as fragile and deeply personal.Your search uncovered a darker truth. A hidden group had been using corrupted berryvines to lure and drive malformed dragons south, treating them as mistakes that needed to be erased. When you confronted their leader, Yarnim, the fight took a sudden turn. Rather than fleeing or surrendering, he tried to destroy one of the dragon eggs outright.You stopped him, but not before the egg was badly damaged.Getting the baby dragon back to safety was tense and uncertain. Every movement felt like it mattered. In the end, the hatchling survived.You returned the egg to Sable, informed the town leadership of what was really happening beyond the fields, and returned to Edgewood. The town celebrated quietly. Not everything needed to be said out loud.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"player/sessions/recaps/session-1-recap.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770512645676,"modifiedTime":1770512989838,"sourceSize":1159,"sourcePath":"Player/Sessions/Recaps/Session
